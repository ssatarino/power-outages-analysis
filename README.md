## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

Talk about how you cleaned the dataset, what columns you used, and include basic visuals (charts, histograms, etc. — I'll show how below).

---

## Framing a Prediction Problem

Explain what you're trying to predict and what features you’re using. Why is it framed as regression or classification?

---

## Baseline Model

Talk about your first attempt at modeling — e.g., linear regression. Include evaluation metrics like MAE, MSE, etc.

---

## Final Model

Discuss your improved model. Mention feature engineering, tuning, model type, and performance gains over the baseline.
