## Introduction

This dataset used in this analysis a comprehensive collection of information related to major power outage events across the United States from January 2000 to July 2016. It looks at factors such as climate, topography, electricity usage, population, and land cover across various states. It is valuable for researchers aiming to build sustainable and reliable energy infrastructure to have information on how and why power outages occur. This exploratory analysis will delve into finding possible answers for "What are the characteristics of major power outages with higher severity?" We will refer to outages with high severity as outages where larger amounts of people are impacted (column: CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED). Each row of the dataset has information pertaining to one outage instance, with associated column data such as State, Year, and Duration of the outage. There are 55 columns and 1534 rows of data.

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

Talk about how you cleaned the dataset, what columns you used, and include basic visuals (charts, histograms, etc. — I'll show how below).

---

## Framing a Prediction Problem

Explain what you're trying to predict and what features you’re using. Why is it framed as regression or classification?

---

## Baseline Model

Talk about your first attempt at modeling — e.g., linear regression. Include evaluation metrics like MAE, MSE, etc.

---

## Final Model

Discuss your improved model. Mention feature engineering, tuning, model type, and performance gains over the baseline.
